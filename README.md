# About

This repository contains information about the quality models used in software engineering. It specifically targets the implementation (format) of such quality models and provides a quick review of existing material.

* [Quality Models](/quality_models.html) describes the intended format.
* The [samples](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/se-quality-models/tree/master/samples) directory contains examples of quality models as implemented in tools.
* The [images](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/se-quality-models/tree/master/images) directory contains pictures and visualisations to help understand how the quality models are structured.
* Check also the [Quality Model page on the crossminer/internal-material](https://github.com/crossminer/internal-material/wiki/Quality-Model) wiki.

# Meditor

Meditor is developped by Alvaro del Castillo, from Bitergia. Code can be found on GitHub, and a demonstration instance using the Docker image is available too:

* Meditor on GitHub: [https://github.com/acs/meditor](https://github.com/acs/meditor)
* Meditor demonstrator: [http://meditor.castalia.camp](http://meditor.castalia.camp)

# Examples

The following examples and tools are used in the process:

* [Alambic](https://alambic.io) and the [default alambic quality model](samples/qm_alambic.json) for the Eclipse forge.
* [Ossmeter](http://crossminer.org) and its [default quality model](samples/qm_ossmeter.json).
* [PolarSys](https://polarsys.org) and its [quality model](samples/qm_polarsys.json) as [defined by its members](https://wiki.polarsys.org/EclipseQualityModel).
