# About

This repository contains information about the quality models used in software engineering. It specifically targets the implementation (format) of such quality models and provides a quick review of existing material.

* Quality Models describes the intended format.
* The `samples` directory contains examples of quality models as implemented in tools.
* The `images` directory contains pictures and visualisations to help understand how the quality models are structured.

# Examples

The following examples and tools are used in the process:

* [Alambic](https://alambic.io) and the [default alambic quality model](samples/qm_alambic.json) for the Eclipse forge.
* [Ossmeter](http://crossminer.org) and its [default quality model](samples/qm_ossmeter.json).
* [PolarSys](https://polarsys.org) and its [quality model](samples/qm_polarsys.json) as [defined by its members](https://wiki.polarsys.org/EclipseQualityModel).
